## Sum Array

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### :airplane: Starting off

Create a file called sumarray.js

**Summing the numbers in an array**

Create a function that, given an array of integers, returns the sum of those numbers added together.

Use what you learned from the TwilioQuest streams so far to write a function, write a for loop over the numbers, and return the values!


### :pencil: Commenting your Code

Use in line comments to explain how your code works. Commenting your code helps ensure that you understand what is happening, and helps the code reviewer read through your code easily. For example:

**Great example:**
```
var i; // Initialize a variable
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { // Initialize a for loop that iterates from 0 to length of the nums array
  nums[i]+5; // At every iteration, add the i-th integer in the nums array to the text variable
} // End of loop
```

When you start writing more code (200+ lines) you will want to do the next example. For this course, your code should not extend past 50-100 lines and we want to use your comments to see how well you understand the concepts and language, so it's better to use the previous example.

**Okay example:**
```
// This code uses a for loop to iterate through the entire nums array and add 5 to each element
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}
```

**Don't do this:**
```
// Add 5 to all values in nums array
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}
```

### :red_car: Running your Code

1. Save your file
2. Make sure you're in the same directory in which you saved your sumarray.js file
3. To run your fancy new program, type: ```node sumarray.js``` in terminal

### :pencil2: Testing

1. To test your program, you first want to create and initialize an array (check below). Here we're going to create one called ```numbers``` and initialize with 5 integers.
2. You can then run your function ```sum``` on the array ```numbers``` and print to console.

**Test Case 1:**

Add the following lines of code below your function:
```
let numbers = [3,5,1,9,12];
console.log("The sum is", sum(numbers));
```
The output should be:
```
The sum is 30
```

**Test Case 2:**

Add the following lines of code below your function:
```
let numbers = [-4, 5, 6, 2, -8];
console.log("The sum is", sum(numbers));
```
The output should be:
```
The sum is 1
```

**Output example:**
