### :airplane: Starting off

Create a file called romanint.js

**Roman Numerals (problem description from LeetCode)**

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       | Value
---          | ---
I            | 1
V            | 5
X            | 10
L            | 50
C            | 100
D            | 500
M            | 1000

For example, 2 is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number 27 is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

### :red_car: Running your Code

1. Save your file
2. Make sure you're in the same directory in which you saved your romanint.js file
3. To run your fancy new program, type: ```node romanint.js``` in terminal

### :pencil2: Testing

1. To test your program, you first want to create and initialize an array (check below). Here we're going to create one called ```numbers``` and initialize with 5 integers.
2. You can then run your function ```sum``` on the array ```numbers``` and print to console.

**Test Case 1:**

Add the following lines of code to below your function:
```
console.log(romanToInt(""));
```
The output should be:
```
0
```

**Test Case 2:**

Add the following lines of code to below your function:
```
console.log(romanToInt("XXVII"));
```
The output should be:
```
27
```


**More Test Cases:**

**Example 1:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("III"));`  
Output: 3  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("IV"));`  
Output: 4  

**Example 3:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("IX"));`  
Output: 9  

**Example 4:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("LVIII"));`  
Output: 58  
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.  

**Example 5:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("MCMXCIV"));`  
Output: 1994  
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.  

### :white_check_mark: Submit

**Task 1: Complete the Roman to Int program as described above**

Commit a file called romanint.js

Great job, you're teaching javascript to the Romans!
