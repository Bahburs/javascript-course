## Recursive Art

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

You've received some signals from aliens that decode to result in intricate graphics. These images have patterns that seem to repeat themselves and represent mathematical concepts which appear all around earth in nature. You have decided to recreate these messages in order to resume communication with the extraterrestrials.
### :airplane: Phase 3

For this lesson, we're just going to be taking a look at an example of recursive art to get your gears running.

**:eyes: Taking a peek at an example**



### :question: What's happening?

### :pencil2: Requirements

In the next part, you're going to be creating *your own* recursive art, but we'll be adding some requirements:
1) Have a base case (*This is the "endpoint" where the calculation terminates or stops*)
    * Remember: Recursion is **not** an infinite loop!
2) Have a rule that causes the calculation continue or go deeper and deeper (continues the recursion)
3) For fun: the artwork must be randomized, meaning that a characteristic (can be size, color, length, or shape) is changed everytime the code is run

*These requirements are exemplified in the example above, so let's talk a little about how the code incorporates them*

### âœ… Submit

**Time to do some research: Find *one* example of recursion in nature and explain how *one* of the requirements applies.**
