## Recursive Art

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

You've received some signals from aliens that decode to result in intricate graphics. These images have patterns that seem to repeat themselves and represent mathematical concepts which appear all around earth in nature. You have decided to recreate these messages in order to resume communication with the extraterrestrials.
### :airplane: Phase 3

For this lesson, we're just going to be taking a look at an example of recursive art to get your gears running.

**:eyes: Taking a peek at an example**

### :question: What's happening?

**The key to recursion is `drawShape()` in this program**

Before we get into how this drawing is done with the concept, we'll go over what's happening.

* The *very first* time the function is called, x = 200, y = 200, size = 360, and orientation = false.
```js
drawShape(200, 200, 360, false);
```

* In the function, the parameter `orientation` determines which way the arc should face (up or down). In this case, it's false, so we are drawing an arc face down.
```js
    // start and stop degrees of arc
    var start = 0;
    var stop = 180;
    
    // if arc is right side up, switch start and stop so arc becomes right side up
    if (orientation) {
        start = 180;
        stop = 360;
    }
```

* We then draw our first arc with the parameters called with the function (x = 200, y = 200, size = 360, and orientation = false)
```js
    // draw arc
    arc(x, y, size, size, start, stop);
```

* The variable `orientation` also dictates where the arc should begin to draw:
```js
    if (orientation) {
        x = x + scale * size;
    } else {
        x = x - scale * size;
    }
```

* Next we see `var scale = 0.085;`, which is a key component in the recursion calculation. This is what causes the arcs to get smaller as we go deeper and deeper.
* And that leads into our the key calculation! For the arcs to become spirals, if orientation is `true` (or the arc is facing up) it will move the pen to the right. If orientation is `false` (or the arc is facing down) the pen will start further to the left instead. This allows the shell to spiral and get smaller.
> Keep in mind, these new calculated values will be applied the next time the function is called. In additional to different x values, we will also make the radius smaller by assigning a new value to `size`
```js
    // adjust x coordinate of next arc depending on orientation of arc
    if (orientation) {
        x = x + scale * size;
    } else {
        x = x - scale * size;
    }
```
* In order for the arc to stay centered *and* decrease in size, we also need to calculate a `newSize` value. `var newSize = size/1.2;`
* Lastly, to continue the recursion we need to call our `drawShape()` function again, but with some catches.
```js
    if (newSize >= 4) {
        drawShape(x, y, newSize, !orientation);
    }
```
> 1. Since recursion is not an infinite loop, we want the function to stop being called once the size is less than 4
> 2. We want to flip the boolean of orientation so that if it previously drew an arc facing down, we will now draw one facing up.

**And that's it! `drawShape()` will continue to be called, arcs will continue to be drawn, and new values will be calculated until the size becomes less than 4.**


### :pencil2: Requirements

In the next part, you're going to be creating *your own* recursive art, but we'll be adding some requirements:
1) Have a base case (*This is the "endpoint" where the calculation terminates or stops*)
    * Remember: Recursion is **not** an infinite loop!
2) Have a rule that causes the calculation continue or go deeper and deeper (continues the recursion)
3) For fun and **not demonstrated in the example**: the artwork must be randomized, meaning that a characteristic (can be size, color, length, or shape) is changed everytime the code is run

*These requirements are exemplified in the example above, so let's talk a little about how the code incorporates them*

1) The base case in the example is when the size is divided by 1.2 so many times that it becomes less than 4. *This is when the calculation terminates and the function is not called anymore*
2) The rule that causes the calculation to go deeper is the fact that function will need to be continuously called within eachother until size is less than 4.

### âœ… Submit

**Time to do some research: Find *one* example of recursion in nature and explain how *one* of the requirements applies.**
