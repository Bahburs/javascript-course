## Sentence Concat

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### :airplane: Starting off

Create a file called sentenceconcat.js

**Concatenating words in a sentence**

Create a function that, given an array of strings, returns a sentence of all the words in that order. That is, concatenate all of the provided strings with spaces in between and a period at the end.

Use what you learned from the TwilioQuest streams so far to write a function, write a for loop over the input strings, and return the final sentence!

### :red_car: Running your Code

1. Save your file
2. Make sure you're in the same directory in which you saved your sentenceconcat.js file
3. To run your fancy new program, type: ```node sentenceconcat.js``` in terminal

### :pencil2: Testing

1. To test your program, you first want to create and initialize an array (check below). Here we're going to create one called ```words``` and initialize with a bunch of strings.
2. You can then run your function ```sentence``` on the array ```words``` and print to console.

**Test Case 1:**

Add the following lines of code to below your function:
```
let words = ["JavaScript", "is", "so", "awesome" , "ðŸ‘¾"];
console.log(sentence(words));
```
The output should be:
```
JavaScript is so awesome ðŸ‘¾ .
```

**Test Case 2:**

Just for fun, create a variable above your function. Call it ```name``` and initialize it to your name.

Add the following lines of code to below your function (replacing "Javascript" with name):
```
let words = [name, "is", "so", "awesome" , "ðŸ‘¾"];
console.log(sentence(words));
```

The output should be:
```
Shreya is so awesome ðŸ‘¾ .
```

with the first word as your name!

**Try making your own test cases to explore what your new concatenation function can do!**

### âœ… Submit

**Task 2: Complete a function that creates a sentence as described above!**

Commit a file called sentenceconcat.js

Great job, the robots can speak now, and they keep asking for more batteries!
