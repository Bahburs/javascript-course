## Alphabet

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### :airplane: Starting off

Create a file called alphabet.js

**Printing the Alphabet**

Use what you learned from the TwilioQuest streams so far to write a for loop that iterates over the letters of the alphabet and prints them to console.

### :pencil: Commenting your Code

Use in line comments to explain how your code works. Commenting your code helps ensure that you understand what is happening, and helps the code reviewer read through your code easily. For example:

**Great example:**

```
var i; // Initialize a variable
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { // Initialize a for loop that iterates from 0 to length of the nums array
  nums[i]+5; // At every iteration, add the i-th integer in the nums array to the text variable
} // End of loop

```

When you start writing more code (200+ lines) you will want to do the next example. For this course, your code should not extend past 50-100 lines and we want to use your comments to see how well you understand the concepts and language, so it's better to use the previous example.

**Okay example:**

```
// This code uses a for loop to iterate through the entire nums array and add 5 to each element
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}

```

**Don't do this:**

```
// Add 5 to all values in nums array
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}

```

### :red_car: Running your Code

1. Save your file
2. Make sure you're in the same directory in which you saved your alphabet.js file
3. To run your fancy new program, type: `node alphabet.js` in terminal

### :pencil2: Testing

To test your program, run you code and compare your output to the alphabet.

### âœ… Submit

**Task 2: Complete a function that prints the alphabet as described above!**
