## Roman Calculator

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

You're a time traveller who is about to go back in time and want to build a bunch of cool devices for the people back in the day. You decide to build a basic calculator since math is the coolest subject in the world and you want to help the romans become really efficient in their calculations.

### :airplane: Phase 3

Continue working in romancalc.js

**Converting from Roman Numerals to Integers**

You have now successfully created a calculator and a way to get the users's input. The issue is that since you're taking this calculator to the Romans, your calculator needs to be able to work with Roman Numerals.

Create a function called romanToInt() that takes a string of characters as input and converts it to an integer, and returns the converted integer.

### :pencil: Commenting your Code

Use in line comments to explain how your code works. Commenting your code helps ensure that you understand what is happening, and helps the code reviewer read through your code easily. For example:

**Great example:**

```
var i; // Initialize a variable
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { // Initialize a for loop that iterates from 0 to length of the nums array
  nums[i]+5; // At every iteration, add the i-th integer in the nums array to the text variable
} // End of loop

```

When you start writing more code (200+ lines) you will want to do the next example. For this course, your code should not extend past 50-100 lines and we want to use your comments to see how well you understand the concepts and language, so it's better to use the previous example.

**Okay example:**

```
// This code uses a for loop to iterate through the entire nums array and add 5 to each element
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}

```

**Don't do this:**

```
// Add 5 to all values in nums array
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}

```

### :red_car: Running your Code

1. Save your file
2. Make sure you're in the same directory in which you saved your romancalc.js file
3. To run your fancy new program, type: `node romancalc.js` in terminal with any additional arguments

### :pencil2: Testing

Add ```console.log(romanToInt("process.argv[2]"));``` to the end of your code and run ```node romancalc.js a``` where 'a' is the Roman Numeral you want to convert

**Test Case 1:**

**Input:** ```node romancalc.js 4```

**Output: NaN (error)**

**Test Case 1:**

**Input:** ```node romancalc.js IV```

**Output: 4**

**Test Case 1:** 

**Input: `**``node romancalc.js CMXXVII```

**Output: 927**
