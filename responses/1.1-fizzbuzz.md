## FizzBuzz In SPACE

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### :airplane: Starting off

Create a file called fizzbuzz.js

**FizzBuzz**

FizzBuzz is a program used to demonstrate basic functionality of a language, often when switching between programing languages or as an introduction (that's us!) to first learning a language.

The goals of the program is to go through the numbers from 1 to 100 and print "fizz" whenever a number is divisible by 3, print "buzz" when it's divisible by 5, print "fizzbuzz" when it's divisible by both 3 and 5, and print the number when it's not divisible by either. For our program, you will do something very similar:

For the numbers from 1 to 100:
* print ğŸ‘½ and the number if it is divisible by 3
* print ğŸš€ and the number if it is divisible by 5
* print ğŸ›° and the number if it is divisible by both 3 and 5
* print ğŸ’© and the number if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5

Tip: copy paste the emojis to get it into your code!

### :red_car: Running your Code

1. Save your file
2. Make sure you're in the same directory in which you saved your fizzbuzz.js file

In this program, you need to allow your program to take a second argument, so:
3. To run your fancy new program, type: ```node fizzbuzz.js``` with an integer between 1-100 in terminal

### :pencil2: Testing

To test your code, run it with different integers in the program argument to see what happens.

**Test Case 1:**

If you run ```node fizzbuzz.js 5``` the output should be:

```
ğŸ’© 1
ğŸ’© 2
ğŸ‘½ 3
ğŸ’© 4
ğŸš€ 5
```

**Test Case 2:**

If you run ```node fizzbuzz.js 17``` the output should be:

```
ğŸ’© 1
ğŸ’© 2
ğŸ‘½ 3
ğŸ’© 4
ğŸš€ 5
ğŸ‘½ 6
ğŸ’© 7
ğŸ’© 8
ğŸ‘½ 9
ğŸš€ 10
ğŸ’© 11
ğŸ‘½ 12
ğŸ’© 13
ğŸ’© 14
ğŸ›° 15
ğŸ’© 16
ğŸ’© 17
```
