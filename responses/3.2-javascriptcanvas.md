## Recursive Art

*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

You've received some signals from aliens that decode to result in intricate graphics. These images have patterns that seem to repeat themselves and represent mathematical concepts which appear all around earth in nature. You have decided to recreate these messages in order to resume communication with the extraterrestrials.
### :airplane: Phase 2

Create a new file named drawing.js

**Learning how to draw in JavaScript**

*In your project for this week, you will mainly focus on creating a function that will draw **one** shape continuously, so keep these handy!*

Shapes: 
* Rectangle: `rect(x, y, w, h)`
* Ellipse: `ellipse(x, y, w, h)`
* Triangle: `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
* Line: `line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
* Point: `point(x, y)`
* Arc: `arc(x, y, w, h, start, stop)`
* Bezier: `bezier(x1, y1, cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2, x2, y2)`
* Quadrilateral: `quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)`
* Image: `image(image, x, y, width*, height*)`

*For more complex shapes and examples, visit [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/recursive-algorithms/pp/project-recursive-art)* (Thank you Khan!)

Want to be :sparkles:fancy:sparkles:? Try changing the colors:
* `background(r, g, b)` (Set background color)
* `fill(r, g, b)` (Set fill color)
* `noFill()` (Stop filling in shapes)
* `stroke(r, g, b)` (Set the outline color for shapes)
* `strokeWeight(thickness)` (Alter thickness of strokes)
* `noStroke()` (Stop outlining for shapes)
* `color(r, g, b)` (Store a color in a variable)
* `blendColor(c1, c2, MODE)` (Blend two colors)
* `lerpColor(c1, c2, amount)` (Using 2 colors, find one in between)

Randomizing Your Drawing
* Using `Math.random()*n` gives you a random number in the range of 0 and n.
> Tip: Try manipulating the number in some way to incorporate it into the parameter of a shape or color

**Challenge**

To practice implementing the concept of recursion in JavaScript art, start by creating a drawing of an alien (doesn't have to be perfect!). This drawing will be unique each separate time you run the program.

### :red_car: Running your Code

*Since we are focusing on pure JavaScript and this task requires HTML to run, we are going to be borrowing Khan's website to display our artwork.*
1. Go to this [website](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/new/pjs)
2. Write your code in the provided area
3. If your code doesn't have output that will be different everytime, the drawing will update whenever you change the code
3. If you implement something like randomization, a "restart" button will appear to run it multiple times

### :pencil2: Testing

Time to check if you are able to create a unique :alien: everytime, press "restart" and see the face change!

### âœ… Submit

**Phase 2: Complete a program that draws a unique alien**

Commit a file called drawing.js
